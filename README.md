# Welcome to the One and only Mario Kart!

## Project Introduction
This is a project I made for my Intermediate JS course for my nanodegree. The theme of the project was asynchronous Javascript. Theres many calls to an API to perform a race.
### Start the Server

The game engine has been compiled down to a binary so that you can run it on any system. Because of this, you cannot edit the API in any way, it is just a black box that we interact with via the API endpoints.

To run the server, locate your operating system and run the associated command in your terminal at the root of the project.

| Your OS               | Command to start the API                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux` |

If you are on an older OS and the above command doesn't run for you - or if you know that you are running a 32bit system - add `-32` to the end of the file name. For reference, here are the same commands but for a 32-bit system.

| 32 Bit Systems Only!  | Command to start the API                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx-32`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-32.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux-32` |

Note that this process will use your terminal tab, so you will have to open a new tab and navigate back to the project root to start the front end.

### Start the Frontend

First, run your preference of `npm install && npm start` or `yarn && yarn start` at the root of this project. Then you should be able to access http://localhost:3000.

### API Calls

Below are a list of the API endpoints and the shape of the data they return. This is just for reference.

[GET] `api/tracks`
List of all tracks

- id: number (1)
- name: string ("Track 1")
- segments: number[]([87,47,29,31,78,25,80,76,60,14....])

[GET] `api/cars`
List of all cars

- id: number (3)
- driver_name: string ("Racer 1")
- top_speed: number (500)
- acceleration: number (10)
- handling: number (10)

[GET] `api/races/${id}`
Information about a single race

- status: RaceStatus ("unstarted" | "in-progress" | "finished")
- positions object[] ([{ car: object, final_position: number (omitted if empty), speed: number, segment: number}])

[POST] `api/races`
Create a race

- id: number
- track: string
- player_id: number
- cars: Cars[] (array of cars in the race)
- results: Cars[] (array of cars in the position they finished, available if the race is finished)

[POST] `api/races/${id}/start`
Begin a race

- Returns nothing

[POST] `api/races/${id}/accelerate`
Accelerate a car

- Returns nothing

To complete the race logic, find all the TODO tags in index.js and read the instructions.
